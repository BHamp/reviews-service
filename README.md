# Reviews
This is the Reviews component for the Front End Capstone done at Hack Reactor. Our team replicated the Steam website, and this is a simplified version of the reviews module for a sample game.

This app:
* renders and append review data to the page
* incorporates UI with each review like linking to the full review or showing profile data

*Future Updates*
* Profile achievements
* right column bar with recent reviews
* filter function for reviews
* user input for own review
